# Goal(s):
0. replicate work done in exokernel
1. implement ideas presented in exokernel
*Not very creative of me to name this skeleton-kernel
*The goal is to achieve either 1 | 2

## Plan
0. Target Device:           Pi5                                     (DONE)
1. Machine Emulator:        QEMU                                    (DONE)

2. Kernel Abstractions:     Resource Multiplexing                   (TODO: Research)
3. Untrusted OS Library:    greyOS                                  (TODO: Research)
*Define the boundary between Kernel and the Untrusted OS Library.
*Determine what should be exposed by the kernel interface.
